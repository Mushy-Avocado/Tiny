### About

This is an adventure/combat game. You've mysteriously shrunken, and you have to get back to your shrink ray to make yourself bigger again. Along the way, you have to fight insects that try to kill you, such as lawn mites, bees, grasshoppers, and jumping spiders! This is my best game so far.

### #Kajam2021

This game was submitted for the 2021 Kajam contest on Replit. The contest lasted seven days, but I forgot about it on the first day!  I worked on the game for ~2 hours a day until the final day, when I gave a final last push to get it done. I'll admit, I was pretty stressed out that I wasn't even going to be able to submit a complete game, but I think it turned out well. I'll add comments to the code later, LOL.  

The theme is: huge

### Specifics

This game was programmed on [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) and [Replit](https://replit.com).  
It was coded in JavaScript, specifically [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).  
The graphics were made using [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) and p5.js functions like `vertex()` and `text()`.
I used [P5.collide.2D](https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D) was used for the line collisions  

I used the terrain and collisions from a project I started at the beginning of 2021, but I stopped working on it. It can be found [here](https://khanacademy.org/cs/i/5182406083952640). Because I used this, different parts of the code were written at different times. This results in an inconsistency in semicolons, programming style, and efficiency.

There are also some survival aspects that may be left over from when it was going to be a survival game.

### Content

Currently, there are a total of 5 levels, 3 weapons, and 6 different bugs you can fight, including a boss. There will definitely be more content. I'm planning on adding ants, a flyswatter weapon, dry grass (for looks), additional levels, and more. Stay tuned!
